 # Basics of Linear Algebra for Machine Learning
Discover the Mathematical Language of Data in Python
This repository contains the code examples and resources for the book "Basics of Linear Algebra for Machine Learning" by Jason Brownlee. The book is intended for machine learning practitioners and developers who want to deepen their understanding of linear algebra as it applies to the field of machine learning.


# About the Book
Linear algebra is considered a prerequisite for a deeper understanding of machine learning. This book offers a top-down, results-first approach to learning linear algebra, focusing on the subset of the field that is most relevant to machine learning. The book is designed to be a practical guide with concrete and executable examples in Python, helping you learn by doing.


 # Who is this Book for?
This book is for developers who have some experience with applied machine learning and want to learn linear algebra to better understand and apply machine learning concepts. The lessons assume a basic knowledge of Python and some familiarity with NumPy for array manipulation.

 # Key Topics Covered
The book is structured into several parts, each focusing on a key aspect of linear algebra:


# Foundation:
 An introduction to linear algebra and its relationship with machine learning.



 # NumPy:
 Tutorials on how to create, index, slice, and reshape NumPy arrays, which are the fundamental data structure used for linear algebra in Python.



 # Matrices: 
Covers vectors, matrices, and tensors, which are key structures for holding and manipulating data in linear algebra.




 # Factorization:
 A suite of methods for decomposing a matrix into its constituent elements to make numerical operations more efficient and stable, including LU, QR, and Cholesky decompositions. It also covers Eigendecomposition and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).






 # Statistics:
 An exploration of statistics through the lens of linear algebra, with applications to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and linear regression.



 # Appendices:
 Includes a linear algebra cheat sheet, guidance on setting up a Python workstation with Anaconda, and a crash course on basic math notation.
